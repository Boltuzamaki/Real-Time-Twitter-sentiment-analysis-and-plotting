#### Note
- You can run from Jupyter notebook code/Scraping and performing sentiment analysis of tweets in real time .ipynb
- Down weight and tokenizer from link provided in weights folder
- And to plot in real time run plot_real_time_graph.py simultaneously with notebook
- And also provide your own key and tokens of your twitter developer account.( The give key will not work beacuse I have regerated it already)
